## Unsorted

FUNCTION GENERATOR
Buy ICs for ±12V supply
But +24VDC power supply
Build frequency modulation circuit
Add frequency control capabilities in software

MASS FLOW CONTROLLER
Dig up old control software
Build control hardware
Add flow control capability to control software

CURRENT CONTROLLER
Build envelope detector w/op amps, diodes, cap, low-pass filter
Add current control capability to control software

LIGHT INTENSITY CONTROLLER
Work examples in lab kit
3D print part to hold fiber optic or lens against tube
Build circuit to amplify photodiode output
Add light intensity control capability to control software

Pseudorandom Number Generator - LM331, 4017 CMOS counter/decoder
Ardustat arduino potentiostat
ICL7660 voltage polarity converter
Dual-pole power supplies

TO DO LIST from /home/brandon/Desktop/1/README
1. Correct RTC timestamps
2. Pure python interface to USBTMC devices
2b. Compile USBTMC.ko for ARM
3. Thermocouple amplifier
3b. Thermocouple + plasma embed testing
4. Realtime current logging
5. Fiber optics
5b. Realtime light intensity logging

LED to differentiate emission characteristics?
    photodiode sensitivity?
